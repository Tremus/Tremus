### Hi there 👋

I work on audio plugins and I've created a few public utilities (C/C++/JS/Python) along the way which may interest you.

- 📋 [Awesome Audio Plugin Framework](https://github.com/Tremus/awesome-audio-plugin-framework) - List of small libraries for quickly bootstraping your own audio plugin templates (WIP)
- 🎨 [nanovg_compat](https://github.com/Tremus/nanovg_compat) - Wraps my forks of the Metal and DirectX 11 ports of [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg). Contains a few extra utilities. Lazily named
- 🎨 [juce_nanovg](https://github.com/Tremus/juce_nanovg) - Demonstration of 2 ways to use NanoVG within a JUCE app/plugin
- 🙏 [xhl](https://github.com/Tremus/xhl) - My utils folder, all written as single header libraries. Inludes maths, debugging, GUI stuff, thread stuff, data structures
- 🎹 [MiniMIDI](https://github.com/Tremus/minimidi) - Connect to MIDI ports on Mac/Win. Serialize incoming data. Very low latency. Includes hot plugging
- 📈 [fastmaths](https://github.com/Tremus/fastmaths) - Benchmarks of fast maths approximations. Also records margins of error across wide ranges. Contains most trigonometry & exponentials functions.
- 🔢 [wavetable_algorithms](https://github.com/Tremus/wavetable_algorithms) - Standalone app using matplotlib (python) that displays time & frequency information of algorithmically generated wavetables. Outputs .wav & .flac files
- 🔢 [EquoFO](https://github.com/Tremus/EquoFO) - Standalone app in python that takes equations and generates wavetables (wav/flac) & LFO presets for GHOST & Vital synthesisers
- 🔐 [node-juce-unlocker](https://github.com/Tremus/node-juce-unlocker) - Nodejs package for unlocking JUCE apps. Based off of the [JUCE Unlock your plugins tutorial](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_online_unlock_status.html), but uses JS instead of PHP
- 🧭 [FigmaBoundsHeader](https://github.com/Tremus/FigmaBoundsHeader) - Figma plugin that exports coordinates of your layers / text / shapes to a C friendly `.h` file.
- 🧭 [CSS2JUCE](https://github.com/Tremus/CSS2JUCE) - (old) Same as above, except in C++ and the coordinates all use `juce::Rectagle`. Has nothing to do with CSS, sorry for awful naming. If you use JUCE, this is preferable to FigmaBoundsHeader, but worse in any other case.
